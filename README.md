# WardPrediction
Problem Statement
Healthcare systems have been challenged
COVID-19 cases have overwhelm the health systems around the world with a demand for ICU beds far above the existing capacity.

The need of hospitalised patients who are infected with COVID-19 are complex. 

Based on the severity of illness, patients have been placed to a recommended ward (regular, semiâ€“intensive unit, Intensive care unit)
Due to the scarcity, increasing the ICU units is one way to address it, however, one possible approach is to increase the effectiveness of recommending ICU to only those patients who meets the criteria after their laboratory test results.


Objective
By leveraging on the clinical data and laboratory tests, we seek to predict which patients will need to be admitted to a regular ward, semi-intensive unit, or intensive care unit.
